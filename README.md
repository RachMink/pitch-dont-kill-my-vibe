## Introduction
While we were brainstorming ideas for this final project we came up with some solid app ideas, until one of the ideas was to actually make an app where you can pitch your ideas! We aimed to build “Pitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe” (PDKMV) to bridge the gap between innovators and VC’s in a ‘low stakes’ environment. PDKMV allows innovators to post an elevator pitch of their idea on the app, where VC's can then swipe right (like) and left (dislike) on pitched ideas. This allows Pitchers to gauge popularity of ideas before wholly diving into building something up. Our app also allows VC’s to comment on pitches which provides more detailed feedback to pitchers on their ideas. 

## Prototype
Here’s a link to our publicly viewable Figma, there are three flows to interact with: https://www.figma.com/file/95tIvNpz7iHVRys1fqsyLT/BSS-Final-Project?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=d3ATmATQrHhkdk8J-1

Pitch, Don't Kill My Vibe serves as a catalyst for innovation, offering a platform where innovators and venture capitalists converge to shape the future of entrepreneurship.

<em>For innovators</em>, it provides an opportunity to validate ideas and refine pitches through real-time feedback from VCs. With the ability to gauge the popularity of their pitches and receive constructive comments, innovators can iterate and improve, ultimately increasing their chances of attracting potential investors.

<em>For venture capitalists</em> it's a platform to gain access to a curated pool of ideas, allowing them to discover promising ventures and provide meaningful feedback for innovators. By facilitating this exchange of ideas and capital, Pitch, Don't Kill My Vibe empowers both innovators and VCs to thrive in a dynamic ecosystem, revolutionizing the way ideas are born and funded.
