## Introduction
While we were brainstorming ideas for this final project we came up with some solid app ideas, until one of the ideas was to actually make an app where you can pitch your ideas! We aimed to build “Pitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe” (PDKMV) to bridge the gap between innovators and VC’s in a ‘low stakes’ environment. PDKMV allows innovators to post an elevator pitch of their idea on the app, where VC's can then swipe right (like) and left (dislike) on pitched ideas. This allows Pitchers to gauge popularity of ideas before wholly diving into building something up. Our app also allows VC’s to comment on pitches which provides more detailed feedback to pitchers on their ideas.
