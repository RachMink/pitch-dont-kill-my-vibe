TODO:
- remove next-auth from package.json (not used?)
- integrate comments
    - e.g. comments: [{ commenterName: x, commentDate: x, commentBody: x}]
    - VCs can add, edit, delete (need to add a unique id for each comments?), comments
    - Add comment from swipe page and pitch specific page
    - Edit and delete from pitch specific page
- do role management
    - Alternative is to have a toggle that switches between VC and founder view
    - A user can behave as both? They just won't see their own pitches in the swipe tab
- clear form fields after submit?
- don't show score and delete button on pitch card as VC role
- home screen start here button 
    - If not logged in, navigate to login
    - If logged in as founder, navigate to pitches
    - If logged in as VC, navigate to swipe
- VC sees pitch tab, likes tab
- Founder only sees pitches tab
    - Can edit, delete, add pitches from this tab
- Update header
    - if founder view ("Pitch don't kill my vibe")
    - if VC view ("Pitch betta have my money")
- Styling!
- Logo + favicon
