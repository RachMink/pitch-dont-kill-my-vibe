✅Main task: Role management
- Adding a user schema to database may get too complicated
    - For example, how does user indicate which role they are during sign up 
    - Are we able to add a field to the styled firebase auth component?
- Better approach: 
    - Let user play both roles (VC and Founder)
    - Add a toggle on the nav bar that lets you switch between VC and founder view
    - Track this role as a global state
    - When in founder view, you can add pitches
    - When in VC view, you can rate other pitches and view your liked pitches
    - Important note: You will not see your own pitches when swiping
